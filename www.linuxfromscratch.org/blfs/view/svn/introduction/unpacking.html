        <a id="unpacking" name="unpacking"></a>Notes on Building Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        Those people who have built an LFS system may be aware of the general
        principles of downloading and unpacking software. Some of that
        information is repeated here for those new to building their own
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each set of installation instructions contains a URL from which you
        can download the package. The patches; however, are stored on the LFS
        servers and are available via HTTP. These are referenced as needed in
        the installation instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you can keep the source files anywhere you like, we assume that
        you have unpacked the package and changed into the directory created
        by the unpacking process (the 'build' directory). We also assume you
        have uncompressed any required patches and they are in the directory
        immediately above the 'build' directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can not emphasize strongly enough that you should start from a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>clean source tree</em></span> each time.
        This means that if you have had an error during configuration or
        compilation, it's usually best to delete the source tree and
        re-unpack it <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> trying
        again. This obviously doesn't apply if you're an advanced user used
        to hacking <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s and C code, but if
        in doubt, start from a clean tree.
      </p>

          Building Software as an Unprivileged (non-root) User
        </h2>
        <p>
          The golden rule of Unix System Administration is to use your
          superpowers only when necessary. Hence, BLFS recommends that you
          build software as an unprivileged user and only become the
          <code class="systemitem">root</code> user when installing the
          software. This philosophy is followed in all the packages in this
          book. Unless otherwise specified, all instructions should be
          executed as an unprivileged user. The book will advise you on
          instructions that need <code class="systemitem">root</code>
          privileges.

        <h2 class="sect2">
          Unpacking the Software
        </h2>
        <p>
          If a file is in <code class="filename">.tar</code> format and
          compressed, it is unpacked by running one of the following
          commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">tar -xvf filename.tar.gz
tar -xvf filename.tgz
tar -xvf filename.tar.Z
tar -xvf filename.tar.bz2</kbd>
</pre>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            Note
          </h3>
          <p>
            You may omit using the <code class="option">v</code> parameter in
            the commands shown above and below if you wish to suppress the
            verbose listing of all the files in the archive as they are
            extracted. This can help speed up the extraction as well as make
            any errors produced during the extraction more obvious to you.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can also use a slightly different method:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">bzcat filename.tar.bz2 | tar -xv</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Finally, you sometimes need to be able to unpack patches which are
          generally not in <code class="filename">.tar</code> format. The
          best way to do this is to copy the patch file to the parent of the
          'build' directory and then run one of the following commands
          depending on whether the file is a <code class=
          "filename">.gz</code> or <code class="filename">.bz2</code> file:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">gunzip -v patchname.gz
bunzip2 -v patchname.bz2</kbd>
</pre>

      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          Verifying File Integrity Using 'md5sum'
        </h2>
        <p>
          Generally, to verify that the downloaded file is genuine and
          complete, many package maintainers also distribute md5sums of the
          files. To verify the md5sum of the downloaded files, download both
          the file and the corresponding md5sum file to the same directory
          (preferably from different on-line locations), and (assuming
          <code class="filename">file.md5sum</code> is the md5sum file
          downloaded) run the following command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">md5sum -c file.md5sum</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If there are any errors, they will be reported. Note that the BLFS
          book includes md5sums for all the source files also. To use the
          BLFS supplied md5sums, you can create a <code class=
          "filename">file.md5sum</code> (place the md5sum data and the exact
          name of the downloaded file on the same line of a file, separated
          by white space) and run the command shown above. Alternately,
          simply run the command shown below and compare the output to the
          md5sum data shown in the BLFS book.

          Creating Log Files During Installation
        </h2>
        <p>
          For larger packages, it is convenient to create log files instead
          of staring at the screen hoping to catch a particular error or
          warning. Log files are also useful for debugging and keeping
          records. The following command allows you to create an installation
          log. Replace <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></em> with the command
          you intend to execute.
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">( <em class=

</pre>
        <p>
          <code class="option">2&gt;&amp;1</code> redirects error messages to
          the same location as standard output. The <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command allows viewing of the
          output while logging the results to a file. The parentheses around
          the command run the entire command in a subshell and finally the
          <span class="command"><strong>exit $PIPESTATUS</strong></span>
          command ensures the result of the <em class=
          "replaceable"><code>&lt;command&gt;</code></em> is returned as the
          result and not the result of the <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command.

          Building Procedures
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are times when automating the building of a package can come
          in handy. Everyone has their own reasons for wanting to automate
          building, and everyone goes about it in their own way. Creating
          <code class="filename">Makefile</code>s, <span class=
          "application">Bash</span> scripts, <span class=
          "application">Perl</span> scripts or simply a list of commands used
          to cut and paste are just some of the methods you can use to
          automate building BLFS packages. Detailing how and providing
          examples of the many ways you can automate the building of packages
          is beyond the scope of this section. This section will expose you
          to using file redirection and the <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command to help provide ideas
          on how to automate your builds.
        </p>
        <h3>
          File Redirection to Automate Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          You will find times throughout your BLFS journey when you will come
          across a package that has a command prompting you for information.
          This information might be configuration details, a directory path,
          or a response to a license agreement. This can present a challenge
          to automate the building of that package. Occasionally, you will be
          prompted for different information in a series of questions. One
          method to automate this type of scenario requires putting the
          desired responses in a file and using redirection so that the
          program uses the data in the file as the answers to the questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building the <span class="application">CUPS</span> package is a
          good example of how redirecting a file as input to prompts can help
          you automate the build. If you run the test suite, you are asked to
          respond to a series of questions regarding the type of test to run
          and if you have any auxiliary programs the test can use. You can
          create a file with your responses, one response per line, and use a
          command similar to the one shown below to automate running the test
          suite:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make check &lt; ../cups-1.1.23-testsuite_parms</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          This effectively makes the test suite use the responses in the file
          as the input to the questions. Occasionally you may end up doing a
          bit of trial and error determining the exact format of your input
          file for some things, but once figured out and documented you can
          use this to automate building the package.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Using <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> to Automate
          Input
        </h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes you will only need to provide one response, or provide
          the same response to many prompts. For these instances, the
          <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command works
          really well. The <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span>
          command can be used to provide a response (the same one) to one or
          more instances of questions. It can be used to simulate pressing
          just the <span class="keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key,
          entering the <span class="keycap"><strong>Y</strong></span> key or
          entering a string of text. Perhaps the easiest way to show its use
          is in an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, create a short <span class="application">Bash</span> script
          by entering the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cat &gt; blfs-yes-test1 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal">#!/bin/bash

echo -n -e "\n\nPlease type something (or nothing) and press Enter ---&gt; "

read A_STRING

if test "$A_STRING" = ""; then A_STRING="Just the Enter key was pressed"
else A_STRING="You entered '$A_STRING'"
fi

echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"</code>
EOF
chmod 755 blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Now run the script by issuing <span class=
          "command"><strong>./blfs-yes-test1</strong></span> from the command
          line. It will wait for a response, which can be anything (or
          nothing) followed by the <span class=
          "keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key. After entering
          something, the result will be echoed to the screen. Now use the
          <span class="command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command to
          automate the entering of a response:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice that piping <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> by itself to the script
          results in <span class="keycap"><strong>y</strong></span> being
          passed to the script. Now try it with a string of text:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes 'This is some text' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          The exact string was used as the response to the script. Finally,
          try it using an empty (null) string:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">yes '' | ./blfs-yes-test1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice this results in passing just the press of the <span class=
          "keycap"><strong>Enter</strong></span> key to the script. This is
          useful for times when the default answer to the prompt is
          sufficient. This syntax is used in the <a class="xref" href=
          "../basicnet/net-tools.html#net-tools-automate-example">Net-tools</a>
          instructions to accept all the defaults to the many prompts during
          the configuration step. You may now remove the test script, if
          desired.
        </p>
        <h3>
          File Redirection to Automate Output
        </h3>
        <p>
          In order to automate the building of some packages, especially
          those that require you to read a license agreement one page at a
          time, requires using a method that avoids having to press a key to
          display each page. Redirecting the output to a file can be used in
          these instances to assist with the automation. The previous section
          on this page touched on creating log files of the build output. The
          redirection method shown there used the <span class=
          "command"><strong>tee</strong></span> command to redirect output to
          a file while also displaying the output to the screen. Here, the
          output will only be sent to a file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the easiest way to demonstrate the technique is to show an
          example. First, issue the command:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">ls -l /usr/bin | more</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Of course, you'll be required to view the output one page at a time
          because the <span class="command"><strong>more</strong></span>
          filter was used. Now try the same command, but this time redirect
          the output to a file. The special file <code class=
          "filename">/dev/null</code> can be used instead of the filename
          shown, but you will have no log file to examine:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">ls -l /usr/bin | more &gt; redirect_test.log 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          Notice that this time the command immediately returned to the shell
          prompt without having to page through the output. You may now
          remove the log file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last example will use the <span class=
          "command"><strong>yes</strong></span> command in combination with
          output redirection to bypass having to page through the output and
          then provide a <span class="keycap"><strong>y</strong></span> to a
          prompt. This technique could be used in instances when otherwise
          you would have to page through the output of a file (such as a
          license agreement) and then answer the question of
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">do you accept the above?</span>&rdquo;.
          For this example, another short <span class=
          "application">Bash</span> script is required:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cat &gt; blfs-yes-test2 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal">#!/bin/bash

ls -l /usr/bin | more

echo -n -e "\n\nDid you enjoy reading this? (y,n) "

read A_STRING

if test "$A_STRING" = "y"; then A_STRING="You entered the 'y' key"
else A_STRING="You did NOT enter the 'y' key"
fi

echo -e "\n\n$A_STRING\n\n"</code>
EOF
chmod 755 blfs-yes-test2</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          This script can be used to simulate a program that requires you to
          read a license agreement, then respond appropriately to accept the
          agreement before the program will install anything. First, run the
          script without any automation techniques by issuing <span class=
          "command"><strong>./blfs-yes-test2</strong></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now issue the following command which uses two automation
          techniques, making it suitable for use in an automated build
          script:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">yes | ./blfs-yes-test2 &gt; blfs-yes-test2.log 2&gt;&amp;1</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          If desired, issue <span class="command"><strong>tail
          blfs-yes-test2.log</strong></span> to see the end of the paged
          output, and confirmation that <span class=
          "keycap"><strong>y</strong></span> was passed through to the
          script. Once satisfied that it works as it should, you may remove
          the script and log file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, keep in mind that there are many ways to automate and/or
          script the build commands. There is not a single
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">correct</span>&rdquo; way to do it. Your
          imagination is the only limit.

        <p>
          On occasion you may run into a situation in the book when a package
          will not build or work properly. Though the Editors attempt to
          ensure that every package in the book builds and works properly,
          sometimes a package has been overlooked or was not tested with this
          particular version of BLFS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you discover that a package will not build or work properly, you
          should see if there is a more current version of the package.
          Typically this means you go to the maintainer's web site and
          download the most current tarball and attempt to build the package.
          If you cannot determine the maintainer's web site by looking at the
          download URLs, use Google and query the package's name. For
          example, in the Google search bar type: 'package_name download'
          (omit the quotes) or something similar. Sometimes typing:
          'package_name home page' will result in you finding the
          maintainer's web site.
