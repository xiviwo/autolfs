Ginger Linux
=======

Hello!
This is Ginger linux!

- This is a linux distribution based on LFS(linux from scratch), so LFS experience is expected before further readering.
- It's not a linux distribution for newbie. Please don't complain.

Why Ginger Linux
=======
The LFS is best distribution to learn linux building,and the essence of LFS is to build every package of Linux from sources, from scratch,
so that you will learn how linux distribution comes into being, from physical, organizational point of view.
(Linux kernel is best way for discovering how linux is functioning as OS under the hood, from progamming point of view)
While ginger linux try to retain the essence of LFS, and at the same time, get rid of those repetive,meaningless work, like download software, unpack them, resolve the dependency, blah, blah, blah.
You are still in charge of each software build and focus more on software interplay as a whole and  how to configure system to your need.

Philosophy
=======
Engage more, Depend less, so-called Freedom.
Linux mean freedom.

Installation
=======
Glossary:

Host: the system you are working on.

Guest: the system you are going to install.

Assumption:
- Host have development tool installed, like GCC, Binutils, automake, autoconf,etc.
- Host have fine internet connection
- Guest drive(/dev/sdb or /dev/vdb) is partitioned properly and formated in ext2/3/4.
- Guest dirve is mounted on /mnt/lfs(Must)
- Python is ready, and must below python3(Python 3 is not yet test).
- python-lxml on host is installed,(or yum install python-lxml)

Install from Sources:
- clone git
- `python bootstrap.py`
- `cd /mnt/lfs/bootstrap`
- `sudo make`
- After a long long time of build, it will end.
- You should chroot to /mnt/lfs and cd /sources and reconfigure Linux kernel according to your hardware/vm
- Reboot and try to boot into the newly-built linux !
- Issue command: `ginger xfce/gnome/kde` to install the xwindow out of your favor!
- Ask, trouble-shoot, enjoy and contribute!

Build Rpm and install from RPM:
- clone git
- `python gen_rpm.py lfs` to generate specs file for lfs, similarly, `python gen_rpm.py blfs` to generate for blfs.
- `rpmbuild -ba *.spec` to build rpm packages
- `rpm -ivh --replacepkgs  --replacefiles --nodeps --root /mnt/lfs *.rpm` to bootstrap the new system.

- This distribution is closely connected to LFS, as LFS is not strictly linear, so the script/instruction is not guaranteed to work.
- That is why I can this distribution ginger, and it's your responsbility to ask, or figure out why something doesn't work out. But, all throught the hassle and frustration, you will grow quickly, learn a lot and enjoy finally. That is why this distribution comes into exists.
